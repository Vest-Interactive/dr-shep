				<p>We’re proud to say our cost is significantly lower than what you’ll find at most other vasectomy reversal clinics.</p>

				<p>In order to streamline the process for our patients, Dr. Shep’s vasectomy reversal fee is all-inclusive. The payment covers the procedure itself, as well as all associated costs, including a consultation and follow-up visits. </p>

				<h2>How Much Is A Vasectomy Reversal?</h2>
				<p>The cost for a vasectomy reversal from Dr. Shep is typically around $7,300. It’s important to note that our fee is far lower than what you may find in larger cities, where the cost can be as high as $15,000. But don’t let price alone be the deciding factor. While our prices are lower than most, Dr. Shep will work to truly understand your needs and goals, and he is dedicated to providing you with the highest level of care.</p>

				<h2>Will My Insurance Cover The Cost?</h2>
				<p>Most insurance providers do not cover the cost of a vasectomy reversal. However, some may cover the cost of tests associated with the procedure. Our Fertility Team will be happy to check your benefits for you!</p>

				<h2>Other Costs</h2>
				<p>If you live in our fine city of Louisville, you probably won’t have any other associated costs with your procedure, like travel or lodging.</p>

				<p>For the national or international patient who has selected Dr. Shep to perform their vasectomy reversal surgery, please remember to factor in the costs of travel and lodging into your budget. Our Fertility Coordinator will be happy to assist with lodging information.</p>

				<h2>Where To Stay</h2>
				<p>If you’re traveling to our surgical center from out of town, you’ll need to make a reservation at a hotel in Louisville or the surrounding area. Our Fertility Coordinator will be happy to answer any questions you have about accommodations in the area. We will provide a list of hotels for your convenience. </p>
